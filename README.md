### Hi there 👋
Hi, I am Ang-Hsuan Lee(李昂軒). My friends also call me Shawn.

I am a research assistant at the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science specialized in CS+EE program from National Chiao Tung University in January 2020. My research interests cover security and privacy related to networks and artificial intelligence. I am interested in various fields including network security, online advertising, and adversarial attacks and defenses.

I have a dream of studying abroad. I plan to apply for a master's degree overseas before the end of 2020 and study abroad in September 2021. If you have any information to share with me, feel free to contact me at any time.
